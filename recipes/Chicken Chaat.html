       <h2>Tangy Shredded Chicken</h2>
       <p>Chaat is a savoury snack - and Indians love a savoury snack. And this is why Indian food has blended so well with the British culture, as we love them too. Chaat is usually served at the roadside in India and is either vegetable or meat based, served with hot dry spices, sour tamarind sauce, fresh yoghurt and green coriander. There are so many different versions to play with, but they are all about awakening your taste buds with sharp, yet delicious, flavours.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>4 chicken thighs, skinned and trimmed</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>green chillies, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2-4 tbsp tamarind water, or juice from 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chilli powder</li>
       <li> 1 tsp mango powder (amchoor)</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh coriander, chopped</li>

       </ul>
       <h2>Method</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in a pan and cover with water, add the garlic cloves, salt and place on a gentle heat.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 10 minutes and remove from the water and leave to cool. Retain the water as stock.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan and add the onions, cook gently until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the green chilli, salt to taste and pour in the tamarind water with a little of the stock water from the chicken.</li>
        <li>Cook gently and let the sauce reduce. Add a little more stock and cook to thicken. After about 5 minutes add both the chilli and mango powders.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken has cooled, shred it using two forks and add to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir to coat and leave to cook for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the garam masala and a handful of fresh coriander.</li>
       </ol>
