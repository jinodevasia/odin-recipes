        <h1>Chicken Pakora</h1>
        <img src="https://www.harighotra.co.uk/images/recipes/hero/chicken-pakora-hero.webp"><br>
       <h2>Golden Chicken Nuggets</h2>
       <p>A Pakora is usually a vegetable dish but myself and my husband have spent ages trying to perfect the best fried chicken, and this is an off-shoot of those experiments. I thought I'd stir up some Indian flavours into the batter to see what happened, and the results were so good that this has now become a family favourite.</p>
       <p>The chicken marinades beautifully and that gives such a spicy tang for the taste buds. It's all held together with delicious crunch - think typical southern fried chicken but much spicier. It's so simple and easy to throw together and is delightfully messy to share!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 chicken thigh fillets, trimmed & chopped into bite-sized pieces
            <li>2 cloves garlic
            <li>3cm piece fresh ginger, chopped roughly
            <li>2 green chillies, chopped
            <li>Juice from Â½ lemon
            <li>1 tsp salt
            <li>2 tsp garam masala
            <li>1 tsp cumin seeds (crushed)
            <li>1 tsp red chilli powder
            <li>2 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi)
            <li>100g gram flour
            <li>Handful of coriander, chopped
            <li>Water (if required)
            <li>Rapeseed oil for deep frying
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the garlic, ginger, green chillies, lemon juice, garam masala, cumin seeds, chilli powder, dried fenugreek leaves into a pestle and mortar and blend to a rough paste.</li>
            <li> Place chicken in a bowl and add the paste, mix to marinade and leave for at least 20 minutes - the longer the better.</li>
            <li> Heat up the oil in a karahi or wok to a medium heat.</li>
            <li> Into the marinated chicken sprinkle in the freshly chopped coriander and then sieve in the gram flour. Mix together using your hand.</li>
            <li> Add a small amount of water if required to ensure the chicken is coated in a thick batter.</li>
            <li> Test your oil is hot enough by dropping in a little batter into the oil. If it browns and rises immediately then it is ready. Very carefully place the pieces of chicken into the oil one at a time and fry until crisp and golden brown.</li>
            <li> Using a slotted spoon move the pakora around, be careful not to overcrowd the karahi.</li>
            <li>Once golden brown and crisp remove from the oil and set on some kitchen paper. </li>
        </ol>
