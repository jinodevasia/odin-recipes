        <h1>Chana Masala</h1>
        <img src="https://www.harighotra.co.uk/images/recipes/Oct16/channa_masala_landscape.webp"><br>
       <h2>Tea-Infused Chickpea Curry</h2>
       <p>One of the most popular dishes in the whole of India that is usually dipped into with soft leavened bread called patura or bhatura.</p>
       <p>In this recipe I have cooked the chickpeas in tea - unusual I know but it adds such warm and earthiness plus it gives the chickpeas a darker colour adding depth to the masala.

       </p>
       <p>If you prefer use a tin of chickpeas and boil them with a tea bag for about 15 minutes before making the masala. The pomegranate powder adds a delicious tang to the chickpeas. Serve with finely sliced red onions and chillies, with a good squeeze of lemon juice.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
       <li>300g dried chickpeas (or 400g tin of cooked)</li>
       <li>1 black tea bag</li>
       <li>4cm piece ginger</li>
       <li>2 green chillies</li>
       <li>2 medium tomatoes</li>
       <li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
       <li>2 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
       <li>3 cloves of garlic, sliced</li>
       <li>1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder</li>
       <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
       <li>2 tsp cumin seeds</li>
       <li>2 tsp pomegranate powder</li>
       <li> ½ tsp black salt</li>
       <li>salt to taste</li>
       <li>½ tsp garam masala</li>
       <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
       <li>Fresh coriander, roughly chopped for garnish</li>
       <li>1 tsp chaat masala</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Method</h2>
       <ol>
       <li>Drain the chickpeas and place into a pan with enough water to cover them.</li>
        <li>Add a teabag and bring to a simmer. Drain and retain the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Dry roast the cumin seeds in a frying pan for 2-3 minutes until they are fragrant. Crush in a pestle & mortar and keep to one side.</li>
        <li>Blend the ginger and green chillies to a fine paste in a wet grinder and set aside. </li>
        <li>Blitz the tomatoes to a puree for later.</li>
        <li>In a heavy bottom saucepan, heat the oil. Add the sliced onions and cook on a medium heat for at least 10-15 minutes until they turn golden.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sliced garlic and stir until it just changes colour. Add the ginger & chilli paste.</li>
        <li>Fry for a minute, add the blended tomatoes and cook down until the tomatoes and onions start to combine to create a thick masala. </li>
        <li>Add the chilli powder, coriander and ground cumin and stir for a few minutes until the masala starts to become aromatic and thick.</li>
        <li>Pour in the cooked chickpeas and stir to combine with the masala.  </li>
        <li>Sprinkle in the pomegranate powder and black salt and leave to cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>If the consistency is dry, add a little of the cooking water reserved from earlier and leave the chickpeas to cook for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the pan and stir every 10 minutes or so. Add more liquid if required. </li>
        <li>Check the seasoning and adjust if required. Make sure the chickpeas are nice and soft and the sauce is thick.</li>
        <li>Add the garam masala and a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice.</li>
       </ol>
